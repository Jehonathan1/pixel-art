# Pixel Party Canvas ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the Pixel Party Canvas! Get ready to unleash your inner artist and create dazzling pixel art masterpieces that will make your friends say, "Wow, that's pixel-perfect!"

## What is Pixel Party Canvas?

Pixel Party Canvas is a web-based pixel art creation tool built with React and TypeScript. It provides you with a 10x10 grid of squares to work your artistic magic. Each square has its own state, allowing you to toggle between different colors, borders, and hover effects. It's like having a mini art studio right in your browser!

This project was inspired by the amazing YouTube video tutorial "Creating a Pixel Art Canvas in Figma (beta)" by Sketch Together. You can check out the video here: [Creating a Pixel Art Canvas in Figma (beta) by Sketch Together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf5bQ7e5_uQ).

## How to Use?

1. Start by running `npm install` to install all the dependencies. Don't worry, it won't install any clowns or dancing pixels.

2. Once the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the development server. The canvas will pop up in your browser like magic!

3. Grab your virtual paintbrush and start clicking on the squares to change their colors. Hover over them to see some groovy effects! Be warned, it's addictive!

4. Feeling adventurous? Use the Clean Canvas button to wipe out your creation and start fresh. It's like a magic eraser, but without any disappearing rabbits!

5. Want to impress your friends with your artistic skills? Take a screenshot of your pixel art and share it with the world.
